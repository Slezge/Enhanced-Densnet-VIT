# Enhanced-Densnet-VIT
This is a Image classification by Enhanced Densnet-VIT\<br>
This is an image classification model based on VisionTransformer，\<br>
Firstly, Densnet is used to extract image features，\<br>
Another branch is transformed from vison transfomrer with STP, \<br>
and another branch learns from the surface of the image through CBAM\<br>
Operation method：python tools/train.py models/myvit/myVIT.py\<br>
